Use this to set the default browse server. This can be any SMB "master",
and it is used for browsing. The point is that with NetBIOS, each machine
send its registration on the network for the others to know it is alive
(see RFC 1001-1002 for more details). As a client only, this library cannot
receive these update informations and must depend on a SMB server for browsing
operations.
<br>The default is to use the local Samba, but you can use this library
without Samba installed simply by choosing another browse server.
<br>There are several problems involved with network-wide information,
the main one is that every machine as its own vision of the world. On large
SMB networks, it is possible that new elections are made (that's how masters
are chosen) or that a machine crashes...
<br>That's why the local Samba, or the chosen browse server, might not
be up to date.
<br>On such cases, the library automatically look for other known masters
if any, so as to get relevant information. This doesn't change the browse
server however, which is used as an entry point for the browsing process.
<p>This function is mainly useful in native mode, but can also improve
Samba performances if you specify here a domain controller.
<p><i>serverName</i> is the NetBIOS name in ASCIIZ of the chosen browse
server. Default is to use the local Samba if it exists
<br>You can revert to the default, with a null serverName.
